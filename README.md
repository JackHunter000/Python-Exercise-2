Another Python exercise completed on my data course
ðŸ“š Contents & Structure

Below is a typical structure of the notebook:

Introduction & Objectives

What is the problem / question being addressed

Goals and expected outcomes

Data Loading & Inspection

Load dataset(s) (CSV, SQL, APIs, etc.)

Inspect columns, missing values, data types

Data Cleaning / Preprocessing

Handle missing or invalid values

Feature transformations / creation

Filtering, normalization, encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics (mean, median, distributions)

Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots)

Correlations, trends, outliers

Modeling / Analysis (if applicable)

Building predictive models (e.g. regression, classification)

Train/test splits, cross-validation

Model evaluation metrics

Results & Interpretation

Present outcomes, visualizations

Discuss findings, insights, anomalies

Conclusions & Recommendations

Summary of main takeaways

Possible improvements or next steps

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Google Colab / Jupyter notebook â€” for interactive analysis

Python â€” with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (adjust based on actual usage)

Data Source(s) â€” e.g. CSV, database, API

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings & Insights

(Fill this in based on what your notebook shows â€” examples below)

Identified which features are most strongly correlated with the target variable

Discovered that Feature X significantly impacts Outcome Y

Visualized distribution patterns, clusters, or anomalies

Built a model with X% accuracy (or comparable metric) and interpreted its predictions
